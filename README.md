#chat-server-node-js

A simple chat server built with Node JS. Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I">Introduction to Node.js with Ryan Dahl</a>.

##Setup

Run the chat server via bash by running the command:

 $**node app.js**.

To connect to the chat server leave the web server running and open a new tab and run this Telnet command:

 $**telnet [your_ip_address] 8000**

Additional clients can join using the exact same Telnet command.

Press CTRL + C at any time to terminate the chat server connection.
