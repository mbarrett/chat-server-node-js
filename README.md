#chat-server-node-js

A simple chat server built with Node JS. Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I">Introduction to Node.js with Ryan Dahl</a>.

##Setup

Initialise a chat server by using Bash to start the application:

**node app.js**

Leave the web server running, open a new tab and connect to the chat server by running this Telnet command:

**telnet [your_ip_address] 8000**

Additional clients can join using the same Telnet command.

Press CTRL + C at any time to terminate the chat server connection.
